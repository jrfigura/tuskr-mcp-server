"""The get_test_run_timeline tool, and the resultHistory aggregation it needs.

Tuskr records no execution timestamp on a run. `createdAt` is when the run was
opened and `lockedAt` is when someone locked it afterwards, so the span between
them overstates how long testing actually took, often by days at either end.

The real per-execution timestamps live in `testCase.resultHistory`, a map of
timestamp to `{runId, status}` covering the case's entire life across every run
it has ever appeared in. Filtering those entries by the run being asked about
gives the true first and last execution.

That field is why `get_test_run_results` trims by default: it grows without
bound, and a busy run's untrimmed pages exceed the MCP transport limit. This
tool fetches untrimmed pages, reduces them to a handful of numbers, and returns
only those, so the history never reaches the caller.

The aggregation helpers stay in this module rather than a shared one: they are
used by this tool alone, and a shared module would be a file every future tool
branch has to touch.

    Reports when testing in a test run actually started and finished.

    Use this instead of comparing a run's createdAt to its lockedAt. Those two
    bracket the run's administrative life, not its testing: a run is typically
    opened before anyone executes against it and locked well after the last
    result, so the gap between them can be twice the real duration.

    This reads the per-execution timestamps Tuskr keeps on each test case and
    keeps only those recorded against this run, giving the true first and last
    execution, the span between them, and how many distinct days saw activity.

    Args:
        test_run: ID of the test run. This is the UUID after /test-run/ in the
            Tuskr URL. The underlying endpoint addresses the run in the URL
            path, so a run name or R-key is not accepted; resolve one to its ID
            with list_test_runs first.
        include_daily_breakdown: if True (default), adds executionsByDay, a map
            of date to execution count. Useful for telling a run worked steadily
            over a week from one tested in an afternoon after sitting idle. Its
            size is bounded by the run's span, so it stays small. Days are
            bucketed by UTC date, so an evening session in a UTC+2 or later
            timezone can straddle two buckets and read as two days of activity.

    Returns a JSON object with firstExecutedAt, lastExecutedAt,
    executionSpanMinutes, distinctExecutionDays, totalExecutionEvents, and the
    case counts including casesNeverExecuted with up to 50 of their keys
    (neverExecutedKeysTruncated is set when the list was cut). When the run
    object is retrievable it also carries createdAt, lockedAt,
    createdToLockedMinutes, createdToFirstExecutionMinutes and
    lastExecutionToLockedMinutes, so the administrative and real durations can
    be compared; runMetadataAvailable says whether those are present.

    If no history entry references this run but the cases do carry entries for
    other runs, runIdMismatch is returned instead of a zeroed summary: that
    means the identifier is not the one the history records, not that the run
    went untested.
