    Retrieves list of test cases of a project with support for various filters.

    Use this to discover the test case keys a project actually contains before
    recording results against them with add_test_run_results.

    Args:
        filter_project: specifies the project ID to filter the test cases associated with a particular project
        filter_test_suite: ID, key or name of the test suite to filter the test cases by
        filter_test_suite_section: ID or name of the test suite section to filter the test cases by
        filter_key: to filter test cases with key containing the specified value
        filter_name: to filter test cases with name containing the specified value
        filter_custom_fields: maps a custom field's key to the value to filter on,
            e.g. {'priority_band': '<option-id>'}. The field key is whatever the
            tenant named it, so any project's own field set can be filtered here.
            Only fields applicable to test cases can be filtered; a field scoped
            to test run results is not reachable through this endpoint.
            Verified live by field type:
              dropdown: pass the option's ID, not its displayed label. Read the
                ID off any case that already has the field set, where it is
                returned inline as customFields.<field>.id.
              checkbox: pass a bool or the lowercase string 'true'/'false'. A
                bool is normalised to the lowercase form Tuskr expects.
              text: matches on substring, not equality.
              steps: NOT filterable. Tuskr accepts the parameter and returns
                every case in the project unfiltered.
            Numbers and multi-select remain unverified.
            Tuskr ignores a filter it does not understand instead of rejecting
            it, so a filter that fails to narrow the results means the field
            type or value shape is unsupported, not that nothing matched.
        page: controls number of records in output, every page contains 100 records. Default is 1.

    # rather than an error or the unfiltered set. Sending 'true' returned
